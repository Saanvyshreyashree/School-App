        Life at KIIT is more than just lectures and study sessions. Students get a plenty of excuses to take a well-earned break from books. Our packed calendar of events and activities means a new friend is never far away.
        At KIIT, students have a meaningful learning experience while enjoying all that university life has to offer. University is important, but it should also be a time to make friends and have great experiences outside the classroom. That’s why – along with libraries, lecture theaters and Wi-Fi hotspots – all of our campuses offer places to socialise, get a coffee and hang out during leisure. Soaking up the university atmosphere, meeting friends and reflecting on your classes are valuable take- aways of the student experience
